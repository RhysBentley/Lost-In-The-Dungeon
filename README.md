# Lost-In-The-Dungeon
Assessment 2 Industry Practice

This project was for an assessment in year 2 of my  Games Production Nottingham Trent University course. This was used as one of my portfolio pieces.

This was also used to see how to create an inventory system as by this point I hadnt created one fully on my own.

The environment was created using an asset pack made by a studio called Polygon, however I designed and created the level.
